# weatherapp for react native used for android and using expo as framework!
# This simple weather app allowed me to better understand how important APIs are. They allow the developer, to fetch data from online,
# resources in this case Expo Location API to get current user's location(longitude and latitude/coordinates), and apply into 
# the next API, Weather API, in order to fetch the current weather's data outputed onto the screen of the user.
